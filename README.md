# **<u>Machine Learning Internship Project at Uneeq Interns Internship- Movies Recommendation System (Task 4)</u>**

 **In this project walkthrough, we create a movie recommendation system using Jupyter, Python, and Pandas.  By the end, we'll be able to type the name of a movie into an input box, and instantly get recommendations for other movies we might like. We'll start with the MovieLens 25M dataset, which contains movie reviews and ratings.  Then, we'll build a search engine to find a specific movie title in our data.  We'll then be able to create a recommendation engine to recommend specific movies**
